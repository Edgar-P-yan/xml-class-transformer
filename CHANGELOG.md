## v2.3.0

[Compare](https://github.com/edgar-p-yan/xml-class-transformer/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0)

## v2.2.0

[Compare](https://github.com/edgar-p-yan/xml-class-transformer/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0)

- fix serialization, so that `&amp;` becomes `&amp;amp;` instead of staying unchanged. To fix this I needed to fork the `xml-js` to `xml-js-v2`, fix it there, and use the fork.
